# A very very simple neural network.
A very very simple neural network to predict the line of best fit of tree data points.

### Description

My goal was to create the simplest possible neural network, without using any complex code. That is why I decided to use lists and for loops intead of numpy arrays.

This can serve as a learning tool for someone who just starting in the world of AI.

Feel free to modify this code, play with it, and make suggestions.

I plan to make this code more complex in the future.
